The server has been pre-configured to run SSL, place any pages/site
you wish to be encrypted in the root folder “ssl”.

Uniform Server does not include a test server certificate/key pair hence a default
installation has SSL disabled. The reason is one of security a certificate/key pair
must be unique to that server after creating a new server certificate and key pair
SSL is automatically enabled.

1) Creating a new server certificate and key.

   To create a new server certificate and key use one of the following methods:

   a) Apanel: 

   Left menu, scroll down to “Plugin Manager” and click link “Server Key & Cert Gen”
   A new page opens “Server Certificate and Key Generation” click link “Generate”.

   b) Apanel:

   Left menu, click link “Server Security” a new page opens “Security Center”.

   Scroll down to section “Server Certificate and Key (SSL)” to the right the
   link will display “Unsecure” click this link, it takes you to page “Server
   Certificate and Key Generation”
  
  c) Manually

   Navigate to folder “uniform_server\udrive\plugins\key_cert_gen” double click
   on “Run.bat” (You do not need to have the servers running)

   Note:
   Once into the certificate and key generation script you will be prompted for
   three pieces of information. If you are running a local test server just press
   enter to accept the defaults.

  If you have a real domain name for example www.fred.com enter that at the CN
  (common name prompt). The remaining two prompts OU (organisation unit) and O
  (organisation) are not strictly required hence enter something that meets
  your requirements

General notes:

Note 1: Once the server certificate and key have been generated re-start the
        servers for the new configuration to be picked up by Apache.

Note 2: View secure, pages by typing https://localhost/ into your browser.
          Or if you have a real domain name
        https://www.mydomain.com/

Note 3: You can change the defaults for CN, OU and O edit fie:
        uniform_server\udrive\plugins\key_cert_gen\ssl_gen.pl

        Locate this section:

        $str1 = &promptUser("  CN Common Name. Your full domain name ", "localhost");
        $str2 = &promptUser("  OU Organization Unit (eg, section)  ", "Secure demo");
        $str3 = &promptUser("  O  Organization Name (eg, company)    ", "UniServer");

        If your site is accessed by typing this into a browser mydomain.net and your
        company is Fred and has asection Software the lines are as follows:

        $str1 = &promptUser("  CN Common Name. Your full domain name ", "mydomain.net");
        $str2 = &promptUser("  OU Organization Unit (eg, section)  ", "Fred");
        $str3 = &promptUser("  O  Organization Name (eg, company)    ", "Software");

        Create a new certificate and restart the servers.

Note 4: It is strongly recommend obtaining a signed certificate by a trusted CA check out
        Uniform Server’s Wiki for details.

        http://wiki.uniformserver.com/index.php/SSL_Part_2:_CAcert_Signing_Process

        You will require the certificate signing request this is located in folder

        \uniform_server\udrive\plugins\key_cert_gen\server.csr  

Note 5: If you need to create a new key and certificate repeat the above.
