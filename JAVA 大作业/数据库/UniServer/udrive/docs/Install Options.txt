   (That’s all folders including the two batch files usb_server_start.bat and usb_server_stop.bat)
 * Finally copy UniController.exe (found in folder UniServer) to a drive's root. 

These files allow you to start and stop the servers.

 $pathc="e:";          -- Would install to drive e (top-level of disk)
 $pathc="h:/myserver"; -- Would install to drive h sub-folder myserver
