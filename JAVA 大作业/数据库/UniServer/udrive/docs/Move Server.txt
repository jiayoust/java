Note: This script must be run on a clean install of Uniform Server Mona

To run multi-servers on the same PC several items require changing such as
server ports, Apache and UniController executable names. With the exception
of running as a service eAccelerator needs to be disabled.

To manually change these can be time consuming and prone to errors the process
has been automated with the following script: move_server.pl

Run:
The script is run from the following batch file Run.bat located in folder:
UniServer\udrive\plugins\move_servers
Double click Run.bat and enter appropriate values.   

Unless you want to use specific ports and names accept defaults shown in
brackets by pressing enter.

Note: If you change service or Apache executable names make sure these have
eight or less characters.

The script uses existing names and either adds a digit to end of this name or
increments an exiting one. Ports are incremented invalid ports are skipped.

When run for the first time the outputs looks like this:

################################################################################
 Current Apache port = 80         Proposed port [81] :
 Current SSL port    = 443        Proposed port [444] :
 Current MySQL port  = 3306       Proposed port [3307] :
 Current Apache name = Apache.exe Proposed name [Apache1.exe] :

 ===== SERVICE Path and Service names ====

 Current Path = c:/UniServer   Proposed path = [c:/UniServer1] :
 Current Apache name = Apache2 Proposed name = [Apache3] :
 Current MySQL  name = MySQL Proposed name = [MySQL1] :

 ===== Controller Executable name  ====

 Current = UniController.exe Proposed [UniController1.exe] :

 ===== eAccelerator  ====

 If running a single server do not disable eAccelerator.
 For multi-servers enter YES

 Disable_eAccelerator type YES or N [YES] :

 Commit type Y or N [Y] :

If you know how many additional servers you wish to run create them at the same
time, just makes the task a little easier.

1) Extract a new copy of Mona
2) Move the server using the above script.
3) Clone this server (copy to a new folder)
4) Move the server using the above script.
5) Repeat steps 3 to 4 for each new server.

General Notes:

If all the servers are to be installed as a service
there is no need to disable eAccelerator.

If the servers are to be run in either Basic or Disk-root mode eAccelerator
must be disabled otherwise Apache will fail to start.

Remember that to access server pages append the new port number for example
if the server was moved to port 81 type the following into your browser:

http://localhost:81/
